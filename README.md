## Arduino
Arduino is an open-source platform for creating electronic projects,
consisting of both hardware and software components.</br>
The hardware comprises a microcontroller board and various input/output components such as sensors, LEDs, motors, and more.</br>
The software includes a programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) used to write and upload code to the microcontroller board.</br>


### Arduino Uno:
This is the most commonly used board and is perfect for beginners. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog input pins, a USB connection, and a power jack. It is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller.

### Arduino Mega: 
This board has more pins and more memory than the Uno, making it suitable for more complex projects. It has 54 digital input/output pins, 16 analog inputs, and 4 hardware serial ports. It is based on the ATmega2560 microcontroller.

### Arduino Leonardo: 
This board has a built-in USB interface, which makes it easier to integrate with other devices. It also has a unique feature called "Keyboard and Mouse emulation" that allows it to simulate a keyboard or mouse. It has 20 digital input/output pins, 12 analog inputs, and a single hardware serial port. It is based on the ATmega32u4 microcontroller.

### Arduino Micro: 
This board is similar to the Leonardo but is smaller in size. It has 20 digital input/output pins, 12 analog inputs, and a single hardware serial port. It is also based on the ATmega32u4 microcontroller.

### Arduino Nano: 
This is a small board with a compact design. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 8 analog inputs, and a USB connection. It is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller.

## Raspberry Pi
